<h1>Hi, I'm Muhammad Waqas Saleem</h1>

<h3>Energy and Environmental Engineer | Decarbonization | Sustainability</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My journey began in traditional hydrocarbon engineering, where I trained as a petroleum engineer and learned how large-scale energy systems operate. Over time, I became motivated to contribute to climate solutions, which led me to shift toward energy transition and low-carbon engineering. This shift began when my team and I presented decarbonization strategies for the oil and gas industry at <strong>ADIPEC 2019</strong>. We presented our work to industry experts and secured 3rd position among 19 international teams.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I joined the <strong>Erasmus Mundus program (ME3+)</strong> with a fully funded scholarship, selected among the top one percent globally. I completed a double master's degree in Energy Engineering and Environmental Management, studying in Hungary, Italy, and France. During this time, I gained practical experience through an internship at <strong>Air Liquide</strong>, applying sustainability and environmental engineering principles in an industrial setting.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My work combines engineering fundamentals with environmental analysis, life cycle thinking, carbon footprint modeling, and programming to support energy transition, decarbonization, and low-carbon solutions. These experiences have made me open-minded, fostered teamwork, and strengthened my adaptability in diverse and multidisciplinary environments.

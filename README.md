<h1>Hi, I'm Muhammad Waqas Saleem</h1>

<h3>Energy and Environmental Engineer | Decarbonization | Sustainability</h3>

My journey began in traditional hydrocarbon engineering as a petroleum engineer, where I gained insight into large-scale energy systems. Motivated to contribute to climate solutions, I shifted toward energy transition and low-carbon solutions. My team and I presented decarbonization strategies for the oil and gas industry at ADIPEC 2019, securing 3rd place among 19 international teams.

I joined the Erasmus Mundus program (ME3+) with a fully funded scholarship, completing a double master's in Energy Engineering and Environmental Management across Hungary, Italy, and France. During this time, I interned at Air Liquide, where I applied sustainability and environmental engineering principles in an industrial setting.  

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My work combines engineering fundamentals with environmental analysis, life cycle thinking, carbon footprint modeling, and programming to support energy transition, decarbonization, and low-carbon solutions. These experiences have shaped me into an open-minded professional, fostering teamwork and adaptability in multidisciplinary environments.
